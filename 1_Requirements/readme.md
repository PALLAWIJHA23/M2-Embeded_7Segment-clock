#Features

This is a 7 Segments Clock project, developed from zero, using authoral hardware and software. The clock marks hours, minutes and seconds, using an ATMEGA328P microcontroller, from ATMEL. The 7 Segments Clock was developed as a personal project and it was built on an universal soldering breadboard, according with Proteus folder schematics inside this project. During this README I'll explain how to develop your own 7 Segments Clock. :)

#Utility

The code was developed specifically to ATMEGA328P microcontroller using ATMEL Studio IDE. However, if some changes were made, mainly in initialization, configuration and some registers, the project can be adapted to other microcontroller families, from other manufacturers and IDEs. The idea to build a 7 Segments Clock is the same, but some things will change, like timer registers, I/O and ADC configurations.
